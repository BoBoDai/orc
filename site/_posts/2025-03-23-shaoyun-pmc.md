The Apache ORC Project Management Committee (PMC) is happy to announce that Shaoyun Chen has joined us as a new member of the PMC. Chaoyun has been showing consistent contributions as a committer, and participated in both major and maintenance releases by actively helping the release managers with testing the release candidates.

Please join me in welcoming Shaoyun to the ORC PMC!
